// const & let creats a BLOCK scope. that means the variable can be accessed only from the block where it created. but not outside from the block.

// if we use var insted of const / let, then it (var) makes a hoisting for itself. that means, we cannot access the value of the var, but program will not show any error. it shows only UNDEFINED for the var variable.
