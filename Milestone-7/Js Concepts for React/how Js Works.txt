1. what is javascript engine?
ans: in chrome, it uses V8, its a js engine. it makes our js code executable to machine. this engine has two part-
1. memory heap [it allocates memory for variables in program]
2. it lists down the task what is going to be executed sequentially.

2. what call stack does?
ans: push a console log inside a call stack and then execute it, then remove it.
for example:

const one () => {
	const two = () => {
		console.log("4");
	}
	two();
}

now if we call--> one()
then, call stack works look like-
---------------------------------

console.log("4")
two()
one()

now, it will firstly remove --> console.log("4)
then --> two()
then --> one()

here, one() inserted into call stack firstly, but poped out lastly. So, it is First In Last Out (FILO) method.

4. what does single threaded meaning?
ans: can execute only one call stack at a time. 

5. why it is single threaded?
ans: because, single threaded is simple. mulithread has deadlocks.

6. when stack overflow happens?
ans: inside recursion. if there is no base termination.
example:
function foo () {
	foo ()
}

foo ()

7. what problem occours in synchronous system?
ans: in webpages, a user have to wait untill a the first execution has completed.

8. benefits of asynchronous.
ans: when we call api, or load an image, then it takes more time. so, if we make an asynchronous system, then the website can load/execute other instructions when parallely the api/images loads.

9. what javascript run-time environment have?
ans: 
1. call stack
2. web api [DOM, AJAX, Timeout]
3. callback queue [works for callback function. setInterval has a callback function. onClick, onLoad, onDone]
4. event loop [check is the call stack is empty or not, when a callback queue appers]

how it works-->
take an example. I have a question to my teacher. Now I can do this in two ways-
1. By calling over phone
2. send a message including the questions to the teacher

in first case, if i call him over phone, then i have to wait untill he receives. this is synchronous system. but if i message him, then after sending the text, i can do other stuffs in between his replies. when he call me back, then if I'm not stacked with other jobs, then imidiately i can receive his phone. so this is asynchronous system. it increases the productivity.
