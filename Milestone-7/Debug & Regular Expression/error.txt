syntax error:
--------------------
1. Uncaught SyntaxError: Indentifier 'a' has already been declared.
[a = 'mazhar'
 a = 5]

2. Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'
[ '{' bracket mistake in previous line ]

ReferenceError:
--------------------
when we use a varibale, that is not initialized yet.

1. Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
[console.log (a)
const a = "hero alam";

if we use 'var' => undefined (hoisting)
if we use 'let' => Uncaught SyntaxError]

2. Uncaught ReferenceError: resut is not defined
[ const result = "hero alam"
console.log (resut)

we should use 'result' inside console.log
** mainly spealing mistake occours the error]

3. Uncaught ReferenceError: functionName is not defined
[when we call a function with incorrect function name, then the error occurs]

TypeError:
--------------------
it is actually DataType error. suppose we want to use (for ... in) on array type object, the the error will occur. Because, (for ... in) => object, (for ... of) => array.
another example: HTMLelement.value => used for 'input' type tag only
		 HTMLelement.innerText => used for 'h1' type tag


1. Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
[ const a = 5;
  a = 10;
we cannot change a 'constant' variable]

2. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of Null
[suppose, we have an id in html file named "element",
now if we call it from js file like this-
document.getElementById("elemet").innerText = "mazhar" ,
then this error will occur. why?
because, we mispelled the 'element' in js file --> 'elemet'.
that's why the -- document.getElementById("elemet") -- is NULL now, so cannot set the property 'innerText' on the Null. that's why it is a TypeError.]

3. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined


4. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of null


5. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'Length' of undefined


6. Uncaught TypeError: obj is not iterable
[if we try to use ( for ... of ) on a Object, then the error will occur]

7. Uncaught TypeError: obj.map is not a function
[if we try to use map on a object... because we cannot use map/find method on a object. we have to use it on array only. but if there are some objects inside the array, then the error will not occur.]

try catch -- throw
----------------------
try catch works for --> runtime error (reference error), not for syntax error

try {

if (condition) {
   throw ()
}

}

catch (error) {
   console.log(error.message)
}

finally {

}
